# Inputshaper PCB

## Backstory

Hi, thank you for taking interest in my design!
In the summer of 2021 I saw the crampon PCB made by annex engineering. It looked like a pretty simple design and I have always been interested in PCB design so I thought this would be a fun beginner project. The result of my adventure can be found on this github page. However, Annex's design probably looks, feels and works better. I have not been able tot test my design yet aswell. So proceed with caution!

The link to Annex's product can be found here: <https://annex-engineering.eu/>

## Technical details

This PCB is based on the RP2040 chip. the PCB uses an ADXL345 accelerometer to measure the harmonicfrequencies of your 3d-printer during a inputshape tuning test.
More information about inputshaping can be found here: <https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html>
I have also added a BME280 temperature, baromettric preassure and humidity sensor, but this is not mandatory.

This is one of my very fist PCB designs and I made it by implementing schematics I found on the internet.
